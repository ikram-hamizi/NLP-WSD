occurs in all doc -> not discriminative (e.g. the)
-patient would have a low IDF score, remove from feature vector, bcz most docs have patient in it (if they're medical docs).

-stop list
-remove plurization, ing, ed, punctiation, capitalization
stemming and lemmatization (lemma).

---
word instance disambiguiation used to solve TERM-BASED VSM problem.

-lexical form of Canine could be different (a different word used in other documents, like dog breeders, will be lost in the feature vector, wount be counted). -> Association measures, semantic similarity and relatedness (3).

1. similarity     : texonomic (location info), minimom path within a texo (pappeys: only using location-info and is-relationship, info-based:). path-based.
how 2 things are in a is-a relationship.
car truck -> is a automobile.


2. relatedness: context of the word.
headache + aspirin -> related.

-------------------------------------------
what doggy (puppy/dog) breeds (types) are good (friendly) with kids (children, young...)

what doggy (breeds(V)/breed(NNS)) are (good()/good()) with kids
           canine	category/type...
           /dog
           

-sementic similarity
-wsd
-pos (breeds), cuz it could be a verb, if we're using AM we wanna first POS the text to make sure "breeds" is a noun.
-lemma -> thesaurus


look for words associated with breeds
taxonomy
breeds=dog types

also kids can mean goats, so we should narrow it down to human kids.



system2 better than system1.


MAP tries to leviate from limitations of recall and precision (IR).

MONDAY: question answering.

--------------------prog. assignment:
rank() = using log liklihood ratio.

we have features (we established which oens we wanna use).
rank them based on how discriminative they are.

| log p(Sense1|Feature1)|
         ________________
         p(Sense2|Feature2)|

as u move closer to 1, log value goes to 0 -> low rank.

************
Fi occured with sense1 S1 3-times, and sense2 S2 8-times, assigned sense 2.

training data: feature exists in test data? yes we assign, no we continue down.

-------------
-sense1: 3
-sense2:4
i will look for more down in the document, if not found go with sense 2.


BINARY SENSES> is for Assignment.
